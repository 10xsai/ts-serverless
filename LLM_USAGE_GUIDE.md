# How to Use @10xsai/ts-serverless as LLM Reference

This guide explains the best practices for providing the `@10xsai/ts-serverless` as reference to Large Language Models for creating new libraries or applications.

## üéØ Overview

When you want to create a new library that uses the core framework, you need to provide comprehensive context to the LLM. This framework has been designed with LLM consumption in mind, following consistent patterns and providing clear documentation.

## üìã What to Include in Your LLM Prompt

### 1. Core Framework Reference Files

Always include these files in your context:

```
packages/ts-serverless/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LLM_REFERENCE.md         # Main usage guide with examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API_REFERENCE.md         # Complete API documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # Overview and quick start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getting-started.md  # Step-by-step tutorial
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md     # Framework architecture
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-management/    # Complete working example
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 2. Package Information

Include the package.json to show dependencies and structure:

```json
{
  "name": "@10xsai/ts-serverless",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "drizzle-orm": "^0.44.2",
    "zod": "^3.22.4",
    "nanoid": "^5.0.4",
    "tslib": "^2.3.0"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "typescript",
    "drizzle",
    "orm",
    "cloudflare-workers",
    "enterprise",
    "framework",
    "database",
    "serverless",
    "edge-runtime"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Key Framework Modules

Share the main export structure:

```typescript
// Core exports available from '@10xsai/ts-serverless'
export {
  // Base classes
  Entity,
  BaseRepository,
  BaseService,

  // Database
  ConnectionManager,
  DatabaseAdapter,

  // Validation
  validators,
  validate,
  BaseEntitySchema,

  // Errors
  BaseError,
  ValidationError,
  NotFoundError,

  // Query
  BaseQueryBuilder,
  FilterBuilder,

  // Security
  sanitizeInput,
  validateSecureString,

  // Utils
  createResponse,
  generateId,
  retryOperation,

  // Types
  type EntityId,
  type BaseEntity,
  type PaginationOptions,
} from "@10xsai/ts-serverless";
```

## üöÄ Sample LLM Prompt Template

Here's a template for requesting a new library based on the core framework:

```markdown

**Reference Materials:**
[Include the LLM_REFERENCE.md content here]

**Core Framework API:**
[Include the API_REFERENCE.md content here]

**Example Implementation:**
[Include the user-management example README.md here]

**Specific Requirements:**

1. Create entities for: [list your entities]
2. Implement repositories with custom queries for: [list requirements]
3. Build services with business logic for: [list operations]
4. Include validation schemas for all inputs
5. Handle errors consistently using framework error types
6. Create API handlers for Cloudflare Workers

**Architecture:**
Follow the proven architecture pattern:
```

src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/ # Domain entities extending Entity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/ # Data access extending BaseRepository  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/ # Business logic extending BaseService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/ # Zod validation schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/ # API route handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/ # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts # Main exports

```

Please implement this following all the patterns and best practices from the core framework.
```

## üìù Best Practices for LLM Interaction

### 1. Be Specific About Patterns

Always emphasize these framework patterns:

- **Entity-Repository-Service Architecture**
- **Type Safety with Brand Types**
- **Comprehensive Validation**
- **Consistent Error Handling**
- **Cloudflare Workers Optimization**

### 2. Provide Complete Context

Include these sections from the reference materials:

```markdown
## Framework Patterns

[Copy the relevant sections from LLM_REFERENCE.md]

## API Reference

[Copy the relevant sections from API_REFERENCE.md]

## Working Example

[Copy a complete example showing the pattern]

## Requirements

[Your specific requirements]
```

### 3. Request Specific Structure

Ask the LLM to follow this structure:

```typescript
// 1. Define your domain entities
export class YourEntity extends Entity {
  // Properties and business logic methods
}

// 2. Create repositories for data access
export class YourRepository extends BaseRepository<YourEntity> {
  // Custom queries and data operations
}

// 3. Build services for business operations
export class YourService extends BaseService {
  // Business logic with validation and error handling
}

// 4. Create API handlers
export async function handleRequests(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Route handling with proper error responses
}
```

### 4. Emphasize Quality Standards

Request these quality aspects:

- **Zero TypeScript errors**
- **Complete JSDoc documentation**
- **Comprehensive error handling**
- **Input validation for all operations**
